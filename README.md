### Adding and making making beautiful views in android

**A Hack discovered in this app**

- Initial Theme is splashTheme but as soon as mainActivity is created 
then theme is changed, through this we can say that we can create a splash effect without making a splash screen, cool.

### Learnings

- A path is not a bitmap or raster, and it doesn’t have pixels. It’s an outline that represents a series of smooth lines, 
arcs or Bézier curves. 
Using a path makes your shapes scalable and independent of the screen’s resolution.

- So we can make shapes either through clipping or modifying elementary shapes like triangles, circles or rects

- Or we can use paths

- Using paths we can create more complex shapes and boundaries
